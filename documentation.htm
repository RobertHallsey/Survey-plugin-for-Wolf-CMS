<h1>Survey Plugin for Wolf CMS</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This plugin for Wolf CMS lets you create different kinds of online surveys, present them to users, and collect their responses in coma-delimited files. You can add a survey to any page, with or without other content. To create a survey, you first describe the survey in a text file, as explained later in this document.</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>
To use this plugin, you need Wolf CMS 0.7.5 or later. The plugin doesn't require a database of any kind.

<h2>Files in the Package</h2>
<p>You should have received the system in a zip file containing the following files:</p>
<pre>
  \readme.txt
  \documentation.htm
  \index.php
  \sample-survey
  \Survey.php
  \SurveyController.php
  \views\index.php
  \views\sidebar.php
  \views\documentation.php
  \i18n\en-message.php
  \i18n\sp-message.php
</pre>
<p>There may be other language files in the i18n directory. You only need the language files for the languages you intend to support. Deleting the ones you don't need will not affect the plugin's operation.

<h2>How to Install the Plugin</h2>
<p>Unzip the zip file to the Wolf plugins directory, keeping the zip's directory structure. Then, log into Wolf CMS as an administrator. Select the Administration tab in the back end, and check the Enabled box for the Survey plugin. That's all.</p>

<h2>How to Use the Plugin</h2>
<p>After you create one or more survey definition files and place them in Wolf's public directory, use this code in any Wolf page,</p>
<pre>&lt;?php if (Plugin::isEnabled('survey')) survey('my_survey'); ?&gt;</pre>
<p>where 'my_survey' is the survey definition file you wish to use. The if statement is really optional but prevents errors if you disable the plugin while there are still pages that call it.</p>
<p>To learn about survey definition files and more, please see the online documention in the plugin tab on the back end.</p>
