Survey Plugin for Wolf CMS

This plugin allows you to conduct surveys and summarize the responses on your Wolf CMS pages.

To install, place all the files in a directory called "survey" in the plugins directory. Move the files called "sample" to your public directory. Go to the Wolf CMS administration panel and enable the survey. And that's it. See online documentation for more info.
