Survey Plugin for Wolf CMS

This plugin allows you to conduct surveys and summarize the responses on your Wolf CMS pages.

How does it work?
The plugin generates surveys based on text files that describe the surveys. The application saves responses collected in text files as well, and the names of both survey and response files are related so that it's easy to know which response file belongs to which survey. This also allows virtually unlimited surveys without requiring a database.

The plugin supports three types of questions. Type 1 is a list of questions, all of them with the same possible answers. Type 2 is a single question with a list of possible answers from which only one can be selected. And Type 3 is a single question with a list of possible answers from which one or more may be selected.

To install, place all the files in a directory called "survey" in the plugins directory. Move the file called "sample" to your public directory. Go to the Wolf CMS administration panel and enable the survey. And that's it. See online documentation for more info.
