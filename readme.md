Survey Plugin for Wolf CMS

This plugin allows you to conduct surveys and summarize the responses in your Wolf CMS pages. It requires Wolf CMS version 0.7.7 or later.

How does it work? The plugin generates surveys based on text files that describe the surveys. The application saves the collected responses in CSV files of the same name as the text files that describe the surveys. This makes it easy to know which response file belongs to which survey. This also allows virtually unlimited surveys without requiring a database.

The plugin supports three types of questions. Type 1 is a list of questions, all of them with the same possible answers. Type 2 is a single question with a list of possible answers from which only one can be selected. Type 3 is a single question with a list of possible answers from which one or more may be selected.

To install, place all the files in a directory called "survey" in the plugins directory. Move the file called "sample-survey" to the Wolf CMS public directory. Go to the Wolf CMS administration panel and enable the survey.

For notes on accessibility and to learn about creating and styling your own survey forms and summaries, please see online documentation.
